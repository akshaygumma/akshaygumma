# 👋 Hi, I’m Akshay Gumma

A 24-year-old builder, gamer, game developer and passionate about shipping fast, automating workflows, and scaling ideas into products. I enjoy the messy middle of turning zero to one — whether it's building bots, creating new games from scratch, or designing smarter AI tools.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- Experimenting with AI game agents inside **Unity**, including a pool-playing bot that simulates physics and shot logic.
- **Real-time Audio with Agora + Unity** – integrating seamless voice chat in Unity games using Node.js-powered token servers and simplified speaker controls.
- **Unity Billiards AI** – creating an intelligent cue sport AI that calculates angles, rebound shots, and errors to simulate human-like pool gameplay using physics and vector math.
- **MLflow-Driven MLOps** – building ML pipelines with experiment tracking, model versioning, and API deployment using MLflow, TensorFlow, and Docker.
- **LangChain Experiments** – prototyping autonomous agents that can reason, retrieve context, and act. Focused on chaining LLMs for productivity and automation tools.
